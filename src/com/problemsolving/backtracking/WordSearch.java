    /*Time Complexity:O(Nâ‹…3^L)
    where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word to be matched.

    For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from).
    As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding direction. Therefore, in the worst case,
    the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L

    We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be N times invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case.

    As a result, overall the time complexity of the algorithm would be O(N*3^L)
