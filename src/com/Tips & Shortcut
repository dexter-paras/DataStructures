1. Use putIfAbsent in map if we don't want to override value in Map
Lets say file already have K = "/leet/code" , V=2
map.putIfAbsent("/leet/code", 3)
Won't update the Map in this case as it already exist

2. Use getOrDefault in map if we want
to return default value in case key doesn't exist in Map
map.getOrDefault(K, -1);

3. Map Frequency
for (String token : tokens) {
    map.put(token, map.getOrDefault(token,0)+1);
}

Why DFS can't be used for shortest distance on graph, but works on tree

DataStructures FACT
1) Always good to have BFS in order to find shortest distance in Graph

2) Always good to have DFS in order to find shortest distance in Graph
    Because in a tree you can reach a node in unique way.

1) Use String carefully when working with backtracking problems
1.1) if using backtracking, use StringBuilder rather than String
