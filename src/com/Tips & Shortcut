1. Use putIfAbsent in map if we don't want to override value in Map
Lets say file already have K = "/leet/code" , V=2
map.putIfAbsent("/leet/code", 3)
Won't update the Map in this case as it already exist

2. Use getOrDefault in map if we want
to return default value in case key doesn't exist in Map
map.getOrDefault(K, -1);
