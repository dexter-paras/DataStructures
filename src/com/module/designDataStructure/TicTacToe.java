 * Approach 2 - IN order to Win Tac Tac Toe , you must need to care only about count of each row or each col and no need to work on full O(n^2)
 *
 * After reading the extremely helpful hint; a much easier approach
 * became apparent. The key observation is that in order to win Tic-Tac-Toe you must have the entire row or column. Thus, we don't need to
 * keep track of an entire n^2 board. We only need to keep a count for each row and column. If at any time a row or column matches the size
 * of the board then that player has won.
 * <p>
 * To keep track of which player, I add one for Player1 and -1 for Player2.
 * There are two additional variables to keep track of the count of
 * the diagonals. Each time a player places a piece we just need to check the count of that row, column, diagonal and anti-diagonal.
