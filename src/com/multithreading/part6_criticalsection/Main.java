/* DEADLOCK
 Thread1 taking lock on Resource1 and Thread2 taking lock on Resource2
 Thread1 trying to take lock on Resource2 and Thread1 trying to take lock on Resource1

 Train1 locking RoadA and hence passing through RoadA and
 Train2 locking RoadB and hence passing through RoadB

 Train1 trying to lock on RoadB as well so as to avoid collison,
 similarly Train2 trying to lock on RoadA so as to avoid collison.

DEADLOCK CONDITIONS:
1. Mutual Exclusion - ONly 1 thread can have exclusive access to a resource
2. Hold and Wait - At least only 1 thread is holding a resource and is waiting for another resource taken by another thread
3. Non-preemptive allocation -No thread can take another thread taken resource. A resource is released only after thread is done using it.
4. Circular wait - 1 thread waiting for resource taken by another thread

DEADLOCK InMemoryDataStructure
Enforcing a strict order on lock acquisition prevent deadlocks
