 * Use this and and not MyOwnBlockingQueue.class
 * Awesome read

 *
 * this - is a reference to this particular instance of the class, and
 * MyOwnBlockingQueue.class - is a reference to the MyOwnBlockingQueue description object.
 *
 * The first example (acquiring lock on this) is meant to be used in instance methods,
 * the second one (acquiring lock on class object) -- in static methods.
